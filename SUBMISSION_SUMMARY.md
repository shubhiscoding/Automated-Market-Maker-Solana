## 🚀 Deployment Information

### Solana Program
- **Program ID**: `HFRstgCb2NeFoGPV5iuoQ6nbrfawKuh1qy9zzN2uBCyb`
- **Network**: Solana Devnet
- **Status**: Successfully deployed and verified
- **Framework**: Anchor 0.30.1

### Frontend
- **URL**: http://localhost:3000 (ready for production deployment)
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript
- **Status**: Fully functional with wallet integration

## 🔧 Core Features Implemented

### AMM Program Instructions:
1. **init_pool** - Initialize new trading pairs
2. **add_liquidity** - Provide liquidity to pools
3. **remove_liquidity** - Withdraw liquidity from pools
4. **swap** - Exchange tokens through AMM

### PDA Usage:
- Pool accounts with deterministic addresses
- Token vaults for holding liquidity
- LP token mints for each pool
- Authority PDAs for access control

### Frontend Features:
- Wallet connection and integration
- Pool initialization interface
- Liquidity management (add/remove)
- Token swapping interface
- Real-time transaction feedback

## 🧪 Testing
